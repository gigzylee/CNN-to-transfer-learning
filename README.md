# CNN-to-transfer-learning
This repository demonstrates the progression from building a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for feature extraction to applying Transfer Learning using pre-trained models. The code focuses on leveraging pre-trained architectures to improve model performance, reduce training time, and enhance predictions for complex tasks.
